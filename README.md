</div>

An experimental framework for exploring AI-driven automated token issuance and market operations on Solana. This toolkit enables AI agents to autonomously perform various token operations, including:

- Automatic token creation and liquidity provision
- Strategic airdrops to incentivize participation
- Market sentiment analysis via NLP
- Automated buying/selling based on sentiment indicators
- Strategic token burning mechanisms
- Social media monitoring for FOMO detection

This project is built as a research experiment to study market dynamics and AI-driven financial operations.

## ⚠️ DISCLAIMER

**This repository contains experimental code for research purposes only. The implementation or execution of market manipulation strategies may violate securities laws and regulations in many jurisdictions. This project does not encourage or endorse any actual market manipulation activities.**

## 🔍 Experiment Objectives

- **Explore Market Impact**: Study how AI-driven automated token issuance and pumping affects market dynamics
- **Test Social Sentiment**: Measure the intensity of social hype and FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) effects
- **Validate AI Feasibility**: Assess the technical feasibility of AI-driven market operations

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### AI Token Issuance

- **Automatic Token Creation**: Scripts to interact with Pump.fun API, enabling automated token creation and initial liquidity pools
- **Smart Contract Deployment**: Pre-configured contracts with:
  - Airdrop mechanisms
  - Anti-bot protections
  - Automatic buyback strategies for market stability

### AI Airdrops & Market Operations

- **AI-Driven Airdrops**: Distribute tokens to SOL donors based on weighted distribution models
- **AI Automated Market Operations**:
  - Market Sentiment Analysis: Monitor discussions on social platforms using NLP to detect FOMO-driven sentiment
  - Strategic Transactions: Execute token purchases during peak FOMO periods (24-48 hour window)

## 🤖 AI Trading Strategy

- **Market Intervention Simulation**: AI bots that mimic retail investor behavior patterns to amplify market volatility
- **Token Burn Plan**: Systematic burning of pumped tokens to alter market structure:
  - Reducing liquidity
  - Shifting price dynamics
  - Preserving limited token value

## 💰 Project Fund Allocation

- **Initial Investment**: 500-1,000 SOL allocation for establishing initial liquidity
- **User Profit Model**:
  - Users donate SOL to the protocol
  - AI automatically issues tokens via Pump.fun
  - 100% of tokens airdropped to donors
  - AI performs gradual buyback and burn operations

## 📊 Expected Market Effects

- **Strong FOMO & Speculation**: Volatile market sentiment driving rapid speculative activity
- **Trading Peak → Correction**: Unconventional strategy leading to significant price corrections
- **Community Engagement**: Spark discussions across crypto communities about AI's role in decentralized markets

## ⚠️ Risks & Challenges

- **Compliance Concerns**: Potential legal issues related to market manipulation regulations
- **Psychological Impact**: Negative user reactions to AI-driven market volatility
- **Platform Restrictions**: Possible intervention from Pump.fun or other platforms

## 🔄 Core Logic Flow

1. **Users Donate SOL**: Funds pooled in designated smart contract
2. **AI Issues Tokens**: Fully AI-controlled token creation via Pump.fun
3. **AI Airdrops Tokens**: Distribution to donors based on contribution weight
4. **AI Executes Market Strategy**: Smart trading to influence token prices
5. **AI Burns Pumped Tokens**: Strategic burning to alter market structure

## 📦 Installation

```bash
npm install ai-token-experiment
```

## 🚀 Plugin Installation

This experiment requires multiple components:

```bash
npm install @solana-agent-kit/plugin-token @solana-agent-kit/plugin-defi @solana-agent-kit/plugin-misc
```

## 🏃‍♂️ Quick Start

Initialize the AI agent and connect to Solana:

```typescript
import { TokenExperiment, KeypairWallet } from "ai-token-experiment";
import { Keypair } from "@solana/web3.js";
import * as bs58 from "bs58";

// Initialize wallet
const keyPair = Keypair.fromSecretKey(bs58.decode("YOUR_SECRET_KEY"))
const wallet = new KeypairWallet(keyPair)

// Setup the experiment
const experiment = new TokenExperiment(
  wallet,
  "YOUR_RPC_URL",
  {
    OPENAI_API_KEY: "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY",
    COINGECKO_API_KEY: "YOUR_COINGECKO_API_KEY",
    X_API_KEY: "YOUR_X_API_KEY"
  }
);

// Configure experiment parameters
experiment.configure({
  initialLiquidity: 500, // SOL
  tokenName: "AI Experiment Token",
  tokenSymbol: "AIEXP",
  pumpDuration: 36, // hours
  burnRate: 0.15, // 15% burn rate
  sentimentThreshold: 0.75
});

// Start the experiment
await experiment.initialize();
```

## 📝 Usage Examples

### Create Token and Liquidity Pool

```typescript
const result = await experiment.createToken();
console.log("Token Mint Address:", result.mint.toString());
console.log("Initial Liquidity Pool:", result.pool.toString());
```

### Execute Airdrop to Donors

```typescript
const airdropResult = await experiment.executeAirdrop([
  { address: "donor1Address", weight: 0.4 },
  { address: "donor2Address", weight: 0.6 }
]);
```

### Run Sentiment Analysis

```typescript
const sentiment = await experiment.analyzeSentiment("$AIEXP");
console.log("Current FOMO Level:", sentiment.fomoScore);
console.log("Market Sentiment:", sentiment.overallSentiment);
```

### Execute Market Operation Based on Sentiment

```typescript
if (sentiment.fomoScore > experiment.config.sentimentThreshold) {
  await experiment.executeBuyStrategy(sentiment.fomoScore);
}
```

### Initiate Token Burn

```typescript
const burnResult = await experiment.executeBurn(1000000); // Amount to burn
console.log("Tokens Burned:", burnResult.amount);
console.log("Price Impact:", burnResult.priceImpact);
```

## 🧪 Experiment Results

Results of this experiment will be documented and published as research findings, focusing on:

- AI effectiveness in market operations
- Psychological patterns in trader responses
- Technical limitations and challenges
- Ethical considerations
